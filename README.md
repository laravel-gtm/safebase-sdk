# Saloon API SDK (template)

Boilerplate for Laravel-ready PHP API client packages using [Saloon](https://docs.saloon.dev/) v4: connector, optional rate limiting, Laravel service provider, Pest, PHPStan, and Pint.

This repository is intended to be used as a [GitHub template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template). After you create a new repository from it, customize the package identity and class names with the one-time init script below (it deletes itself after a successful run).

## Requirements

- PHP `^8.4`
- Laravel `^11.0 || ^12.0 || ^13.0` (for the optional Laravel integration)

## AI and editor rules

This template includes the same rule layout as the `luma-sdk` package: [`.claude/rules/`](.claude/rules/) (`saloon.md`, `php-package-phpstan.md`, `laravel-package.md`) for Claude Code, and [`.cursor/rules/`](.cursor/rules/) (`.mdc` mirrors with `globs` front matter) for Cursor. The Laravel rules file notes that **this repo uses `laravel/pint` in `require-dev`** and `composer lint` / `composer format`, which differs from the optional “global Pint only” wording elsewhere in that document.

[Laravel Boost](https://github.com/laravel/boost)-style helpers live under [`resources/boost/`](resources/boost/): [`guidelines/core.blade.php`](resources/boost/guidelines/core.blade.php) (stub) and two skills — a one-time **[`saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-initial-setup`](resources/boost/skills/saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-initial-setup/SKILL.md)** skill that generates API-specific content, and a **[`saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-development`](resources/boost/skills/saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-development/SKILL.md)** skill (stub until the initial-setup skill is run). The init script renames both skill folders to use your package slug (`{package-slug}-initial-setup` and `{package-slug}-development`).

[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) at the repo root summarizes commands, checks, and architecture; run `./init-saloon-sdk.sh` once after creating a new repo so names in that file match your package.

## First-time setup (after “Use this template”)

1. Clone your new repository and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

2. Run the initializer at the repo root. It will prompt for:

   - **Composer vendor** — replaces `your-vendor` (e.g. `laravel-gtm`).
   - **Package slug** — replaces `saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate` everywhere, including the second segment of the Composer name and the config file basename (e.g. `hubspot-sdk` → `laravel-gtm/hubspot-sdk`).
   - **Short class prefix** — PascalCase, **without** `Sdk` on the end; the script adds `Sdk`, `Connector`, and `ServiceProvider` for you (e.g. `Hubspot` → `HubspotSdk`, `HubspotConnector`, `HubspotServiceProvider`).
   - **Env prefix** — replaces `SALOON_API_SDK_` in the published config (e.g. `HUBSPOT_API`).
   - **Default API base URL**.

   The PHP root namespace is derived as `{VendorPascal}{Prefix}Sdk` (e.g. `laravel-gtm` + `Hubspot` → `LaravelGtm\HubspotSdk`). `composer.json` keeps JSON’s doubled backslashes (`\\`) in `autoload` and `extra.laravel.providers`; you do not need to type those.

   ```bash
   chmod +x init-saloon-sdk.sh
   ./init-saloon-sdk.sh
   ```

   Non-interactive (e.g. CI), same values as environment variables:

   ```bash
   export COMPOSER_VENDOR='laravel-gtm'
   export PACKAGE_SLUG='hubspot-sdk'
   export SHORT_PREFIX='Hubspot'
   export ENV_PREFIX='HUBSPOT_API'
   export DEFAULT_BASE_URL='https://api.example.com'
   ./init-saloon-sdk.sh
   ```

   Preview changes without writing files (`--dry-run` does not delete the script):

   ```bash
   ./init-saloon-sdk.sh --dry-run
   ```

   After a **successful** full run (Composer install, tests, PHPStan, Pint), `init-saloon-sdk.sh` removes itself so it cannot be applied twice by mistake.

3. Update README badges and repository URLs (Packagist, GitHub Actions) for your package.

4. Replace the example `ExampleGetRequest` / `ping()` flow with real endpoints, DTOs, and resources for your API.

5. Once you have added initial request classes, response DTOs, and resource methods, run the **`saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-initial-setup`** Boost skill (via an AI agent) to generate API-specific content for:

   - `resources/boost/skills/saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-development/SKILL.md` — comprehensive development guide with real class names, code examples, and testing patterns
   - `resources/boost/guidelines/core.blade.php` — Boost guidelines with setup instructions and code snippets

   This replaces the placeholder stubs with real documentation matching your SDK's structure. After the init script, the skill name will be `{your-package-slug}-initial-setup`.

6. In GitHub: **Settings → General → Template repository** — enable only on the canonical template repo, not on forks meant for production.

## Configuration (Laravel)

Publish the config (before init the tag is `saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-config`; after init it becomes `{your-package-slug}-config`):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=saloon-api-sdk-boilerplate-config
```

After running the init script, use your package slug in the tag (e.g. `hubspot-sdk-config`). Env keys use your chosen `ENV_PREFIX` (defaults before init use `SALOON_API_SDK_*`):

- `SALOON_API_SDK_BASE_URL`
- `SALOON_API_SDK_TOKEN`
- `SALOON_API_SDK_AUTH_HEADER`

## Usage

### Via the service container

```php
use YourVendor\SaloonApiSdk\SaloonApiSdk;

$sdk = app(SaloonApiSdk::class);
```

### Standalone

```php
use YourVendor\SaloonApiSdk\SaloonApiSdk;

$sdk = SaloonApiSdk::make(
    baseUrl: 'https://api.example.com',
    token: 'your-token',
);
```

### Example call

The template exposes a `ping()` method wired to `GET /v1/ping` — replace this with real API methods.

## Development

```bash
composer test        # Pest
composer analyse     # PHPStan
composer lint        # Pint (check)
composer format      # Pint (fix)
```
